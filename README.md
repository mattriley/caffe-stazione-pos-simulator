# Stazione Simulation

Caffee Stazione ~~has~~ had an aging menu-driven touchscreen POS system.

![Menu screen](/readme-files/menu-screen.jpg)

This system presented two key pain points causing a slow ordering experience for customers:

1. Learning curve associated with locating items within the menu system
2. Locating items customers would describe differently to the name used within the menu system

As a little side-project, I decided to build a "side-car" application to assist with locating items within the POS system.
